		<p><h3>Sample Content</h3></p>

			<p><b>A multi-tier enterprise application</b> consists of two types of objects: <b>application logic
			components</b> and <b>persistent data objects</b>. Application logic components represent
			actions and define methods that perform common tasks such as calculating the order
			price, customer credit card billing, and so on. Session beans model the application
			logic components as they contain the logic to perform the application tasks.</p>

			<p>It is easy and simple to manage the business data present in large organizations as
			objects rather than as relational rows in a database. Business data when treated as
			objects are easy to handle and manage as they are compact in nature.</p>

			<p>Entities are not associated with only EJBs and can be used in <b>Java 2 Standard
			Edition (J2SE)</b> environment. The differences between an Entity and a Session bean
			are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Entities have a client-visibility and a persistent identity that is distinct from their
					object reference. Each entity is distinct from the other because of their identities.
					Clients can use identities to pass the reference of an entity to other applications.
					However, this is not possible with Session beans.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Entity bean cannot be accessed remotely, whereas Session beans can be accessed
					locally as well as remotely.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Entity&#39;s lifetime is not dependent on the application&#39;s lifetime. Entity bean have a
					much longer lifetime than a client&#39;s session as it depends on how long the data is
					present in the database.
				</li>
				<li> 
					Entities represent data in a storage that is permanent as well as fault-tolerant and
					hence, they are long lasting and can survive application server or database crash.
					This data can be reconstructed in the memory. Hence, it can be said that entity is an
					in-memory representation of persistent data that:
					<ul type="*">
						<li>Can be loaded from persistent store and its field populated with the stored data</li>
						<li>Can be modified in-memory to change the data values</li>
						<li>Can be saved and correspondingly database is updated</li>
				</li>
			</ul>
